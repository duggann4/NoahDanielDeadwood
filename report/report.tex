\chapter{Cohesion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deadwood:

    Main() and setup() are procedural, since the elements are disjoint except by order of operations. welcomeMessage() is functional as a result of its simplicity. createPlayers() is functional as well? playDay() functional for the same reason?
    Temporal 
    \item Area: Functional interface
    \item Board: Communicational
    \item Parser: Logical, since the methods implemented here are completely disjoint, except in overarching purpose
    \item BoardParser: Functional, as all public-facing methods are focused on the creation of the board; private methods are helpers in this endeavor
    \item CardParser: Functional, as all public-facing methods are focused on the creation of the card deck; private methods are helpers to this objective
    \item Player: Many methods in Player are procedurally cohesive, since they do many tasks that are not single-focused (e.g. talking to the user AND modifying data/controlling flow)
    \item Role:
    \item Scene:
    \item Set:
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Coupling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deadwood: data coupling with Board, Player
    \item Area: INTERFACE!!! - no "real" coupling
    \item Board: T-U coupling to the Area interface ans Scene
    \item Parser: Data coupling with Role since data passed via simple arguments
    \item BoardParser: Has T-U coupling to Parser since it is a P/C relationship, data coupling to Set since only passed via simple arguments
    \item CardParser: T-U to Parser via P/C relationship,data coupling with Scene since data is only sent to scene via simple arguments
    \item Player: data coupling with ViewHandler, Area, Board(?), Upgrade, stamp coupling to Office
    \item Role: dataCoupling with Player via accessing rank
    \item Scene: data coupling to Role in addRole() setter
    \item Set: stamp coupling with Role and Board
    \item Office: anything calling getUpgrade needs intimate knowledge of how Upgrades are stored
    \item Trailer: Really basic; nothing to see here
    \item Upgrade: nothing to see here
    \item ViewHandler: nothing to see here
\end{itemize}
